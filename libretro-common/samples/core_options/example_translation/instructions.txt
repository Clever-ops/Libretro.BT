## Requirements

Make sure the core is libretro conformant:
both 'libretro_core_options.h', containing the English texts, and
'libretro_core_options_intl.h', containing the translations,
must be present in the same directory.

The scripts are not compatible with text filled in by macros or during run time.
The procedure should not fail - but those texts will not be made translatable.

Also, please verify the existence and correct use of

   #ifdef HAVE_LANGEXTRA
   
and/or
   
   #ifndef NAVE_NO_LANGEXTRA
   
pre-compiler instructions, as translations can't be included on some platforms
with e.g. limited RAM.
For an example, refer to an up-to-date core, like gambatte-libretro.


## Adding automatic Crowdin sync

Place the 'intl' and '.github' folder, including content, into the root of
the repository.

In '.github/workflows' are two files:
'crowdin_prep.yml' & 'crowdin_translate.yml'.
In each of those are placeholders, which need to be replaced as follows:

For crowdin_prep.yml:
    <PATH/TO/libretro_core_options.h FILE> (x2)
        -> replace with the full path from the root of the repo to the 'libretro_core_options.h' file

    <CORE_NAME>
        -> the name of the core (or repo)

And for crowdin_translate.yml:
    <0-59> <0-23>
        -> Minute and hour at which the sync will happen every day. Please enter
           a random time, to avoid stressing GitHub & Crowdin with many
           simultaneous runs.

    <CORE_NAME>
        -> same as above

    <PATH/TO/libretro_core_options_intl.h FILE> (x2)
        -> replace with the full path from the root of the repo to the 'libretro_core_options_intl.h' file

Create a Pull Request and inform @DisasterMo, either on Crowdin or, preferably,
on [discord](https://discord.gg/xuMbcVuF).

The initial sync cycle should happen automatically within 24h after the merge.
