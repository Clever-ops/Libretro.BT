# How to import the project:

   1 - Open Eclipse, do: File->Import->Existing Projects Into Workspace.

   2 - Choose select root directory, and also check "Search for nested projects"

   3 - Browse to the location of the folder named "phoenix" in the RetroArch repository and select it as the root dir. (as of writing, it is /android/phoenix).

   4 - You should see two projects have been found, "RetroArch" and "android-support-v7-appcompat". Import both of these.

   5 - Let Eclipse finish building the workspace, or whatever.

   6 - You should now be able to build it normally like any application.
